react
---------

npx create-react-app (appname)

npm start

building blocks of react
------------------------
html
css
js

angular                        |                   react
---------                      |                 ---------
-framework of js               |              -library of js
-real DOM                      |              -virtual DOM


advantages of react
--------------------

-fast because react uses virtual DOM
-reusable components
-jsx (javascript xml)

components in react
--------------------

1,class based
2,function based


statefull components
stateless components

state- it is an object to store datas inside a component in react

useState - react

props
-----
to share datas from parent to child component

api call in js
------------------
ajax -asynchronous javascript and xml

-XmlHttp
-fetch
-asynch await

first working hook of  component
--------------------------------
useEffect - react

redirection/routing in react
-----------------------------
react-router-dom - library used for routing

Browser router - wrap main component inside brwser router component
Route         - wrap the component inside router which need redirection
Routes         - wrap all the router if we set more than one component paths

Link - a component in react-router-dom used for redirection

useParams - hook used to access params

REDUX
------
when coupling increases in components there is a chance for props drilling

coupling- data saring from parent to child
props drilling - at the time of data sharing parent o child if any 
                 intermediate component have any errors then the data will stuck there


redux - state management technology - we need to reduce coupling and make all component independent to avoid props drilling

store - is a file used to store data in redux . all components can acces the data inside store 

libraries for redux
-------------------
1,redux
2,redux-react
3,redux-thunk

npm i redux react-redux redux-thunk


create store - method in redux used to create a store 

in redux middleware used to make redux as asynchronous (actually redux is synchronous so all synchronous functions will behave as synchronous)

thunk - used to create middleware

http methods in react
----------------------
axios  - library used to api call

useDispatch - hook used to dispatch a function in a component

useSelector - hook used to data aceess data from component
